# 4th Bit

A binary number is a combination of 1s and 0s. Its n<sup>th</sup> least significant digit is the the  n<sup>th</sup> digit starting from the right starting with 1. **Given a decimal number, convert it to binary and determine the value of the the  4<sup>th</sup> least significant digit.**

 

### Example

    number = 23

- Convert the decimal number 23 to binary number: 23<sub>10</sub> = 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>   = (10111)<sub>2</sub>.
- The value of the *4<sup>th</sup>* index from the right in the binary representation is 0.
