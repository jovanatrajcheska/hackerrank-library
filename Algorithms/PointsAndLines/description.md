# Points and Lines

Given two fully implemented classes, Point and Line, read through the given code to understand their implementations. Implement the class LineList which implements the interface ListOfLines in order to perform some operations on a list of lines. Interface ListOfLines consists of:  

- Attribute ``Vector<Line> list_of_lines``  which stores a list of lines.
- Constructor with parameter ``Vector<Line>`` to initialize the list_of_lines attribute.
- Method: ``Line getLineWithMaxLength()`` which returns the first longest line from the list of lines.
- Method: ``Vector<Line> getLinesStartingFromPoint(Point p)`` which returns a list of all the lines starting from the given point p.
 

**Note:** 
- The code stub reads input and calls methods.
